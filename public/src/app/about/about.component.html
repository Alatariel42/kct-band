      <h2 class= "border2" style="padding-top:2rem;padding-bottom:1rem;"> Kaliope </h2>
      <p>
        Kaliope is one of a kind. Big, bold, and brazen, she spurns decorum for the sake of progress, shuns tradition in hopes of a tomorrow we can be proud of, and sings of a world in which anyone can be anything. Singer-songwriter-boss-ass-bitch and former dragon, she hopes to be the difference she wants to see in the world.
        Originally from Suffolk, VA, Kaliope, oldest of seven kids, learned discipline and objectivity at an early age. Her realistic approach to real world problems and lack of regard for the status quo has lead her to Raleigh to find what potential lays within.
